Kotlin Spring Boot, REST API for demo banking project

Simple REST API using Kotlin Spring Boot in TDD (Test Driven Development). I used JUnit5 for testing the project. Spring Boot has many amazing features.

## F.I.R.S.T. Principles for Automated Tests

✅ **Fast** -  fast feedback loop, run often

✅ **Isolated** - independent, arbitary order

✅ **Repeatable** - same result each time, not flaky

✅ **Self-validating** - actual vs expected

✅ **Timely** - with (or even before!) production code

_With test driven development, you wrote first test and it must fail first, then you write the actual code and make it pass_
